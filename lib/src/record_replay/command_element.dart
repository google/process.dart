///
/// Instances of this type can be used in the `command` list of the
/// [ProcessManager.start], [ProcessManager.run], and [ProcessManager.runSync]
/// methods.
///
/// Each command element has:
///   - A raw value, which is the value that should passed to the underlying
///     operating system to invoke the process.
///   - A sanitized value, which is the value that's serialized when used with
///     [RecordingProcessManager] and looked up in the replay log when used
///     with [ReplayProcessManager]. Sanitized values typically will remove
///     user-specific segments (such as the user's home directory) or random
///     segments (such as temporary file names). Sanitizing values allows you
///     to guarantee determinism in your process invocation lookups, thus
///     removing flakiness in tests.
///

/// instances of this class can be passed directly to [LocalProcessManager]
/// and will work as intended.
